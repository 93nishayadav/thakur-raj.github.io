Things used in this assignment:
HTML, CSS, FlexBox,Media Queries,Responsive web guidelines

I also tried giving animations to elements on hover and on scroll. Also found a open source library https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ . 
So just out of curosity used that as well. 

(Since we were not allowed to copy anyone's code.
Im not sure whether we are allowed to used open source libraries or not, if we are not allowed to do so , Please dont deduct my marks ,
ill complete the next assignments without any libraries.Just to be sure I can do it myself as well.Check my commented code for animation in style.css.
I even submitted this query to support team,and i received response as -  submit the assignment the mentor will let you know this.
So i request you to please let me know this as well.)

Thanks,
Im really having a happy learning experience.
